         <h5>Steps</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            Add mushrooms, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and oregano; 
            cook and stir until mushrooms have released their juices and the liquid has evaporated, 
            about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
        
            <li>Transfer mushrooms to a cutting board and clean the skillet.</li>
            
            <li>Chop mushrooms into small chunks, then transfer to a large bowl. 
                Mix in bread crumbs and oats, and season with salt and pepper as needed
                Stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, then eggs; 
                let stand until bread crumbs have absorbed any excess liquid, about 15 minutes. 
                Use moist hands to form mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, into patties.
            </li>
        
            <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet over medium heat. 
                Pan-fry patties in the hot skillet until golden brown and cooked through, 
                2 1/2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
